Instructions: Just compile the CoGr class.
The bin folder has to be included for the purposes of the images in the buttons.

Bugs: as of right now, we don't have drilling working properly, which means that you can cut and paste fine,
but you can't copy and paste because when you copy it's impossible to separate the two shapes.
